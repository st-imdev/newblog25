If you're anything like me and always have ideas for products, the advent of the AI coding assistant has made it much easier (and quicker) to prove out a hypothesis - alone.

Trouble is, my mind never switches off! I now have a long list of trials that I want to experiment with, leading to slight burnout as my brain goes into overdrive.

Want to invent an LLM protocol similar to sitemaps? No problem, just fire up `Cursor`. Want to build a health tracking app? No problem, just fire up `Cursor`.

I've finally started to be a bit more rigorous about what I allow to take up the couple of spare hours I have per day, rather than nursing an ever expanding portfolio of apps & ideas.

I can't be the only one that feels slight overwhelm at this new found superpower.
