This page demonstrates the various **typography** and *formatting* options available for content presentation. It serves as both a reference and a testing ground for different styling approaches.

We can emphasize text using **bold formatting** for strong emphasis, or *italic formatting* for subtle emphasis. Sometimes we might need `inline code snippets` when discussing technical concepts like `useState()` hooks or `API endpoints`.

For important insights, we can use ==highlight syntax== to draw attention, similar to using a highlighter pen on paper. This ==creates a subtle yellow background== that makes key points stand out without being overwhelming.

> This is a blockquote that can be used for highlighting important quotes or statements from other sources. It provides visual distinction from regular paragraph text.

Lists help organize information clearly without unnecessary spacing. Here are some principles of good typography:

- Consistent spacing creates visual rhythm and flow
- Appropriate contrast ensures readability in all conditions
- Clear hierarchy guides the reader's attention naturally
- Generous white space prevents cognitive overload
- Semantic markup improves accessibility for all users

Numbered lists work well for sequential information and step-by-step processes:

1. First, establish clear visual hierarchy with headings
2. Then, ensure consistent spacing throughout the document
3. Test the design across different devices and screen sizes
4. Gather user feedback and iterate on the design
5. Document the design system for future reference

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
