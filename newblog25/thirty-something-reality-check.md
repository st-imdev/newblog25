So I'm now 35, turning 36 later this year.

And I have to admit, I finally reached the point where I no longer 'feel' young.

I'm sure most of you have also had that youthful abundance where you feel indestructible. I kept that feeling with me for quite some time, even encouraged that I was able to both be a morning person and burn the midnight oil.

But lately, things have shifted. The late nights now come with a price tag - one that my body collects with interest the next morning. Recovery from workouts takes longer. My knees have opinions about the weather. And somehow, despite my best efforts, I can't seem to pull off both early mornings and late nights anymore without feeling like I'm running on fumes.

It's not all downsides though. With this new chapter comes a different kind of strength - the wisdom to pace myself, the confidence to say no to things that drain my energy, and a deeper appreciation for the quiet moments. I've traded that feeling of invincibility for something more valuable: self-awareness.

The transition happened so gradually that I barely noticed it. Maybe it was during that first hangover that lasted two full days, or when I started making those involuntary sounds while getting up from the couch. Perhaps it was when "going out" started to sound more like a challenge than an adventure.
