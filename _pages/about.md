  <h1>About</h1>
  
  <p>I'm Scott Taylor, an obsessive tinkerer working on simple solutions to complex problems. Over the past decade, I've built and sold a few startups, as well as written a couple of books.</p>
  
  <h2>What I'm interested in</h2>
  
  <p>My work spans several domains, but I'm particularly focused on:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Building better product development processes</li>
    <li>Knowledge management and networked thought</li>
    <li>Climate change solutions and sustainability</li>
    <li>The impact of technology on human cognition</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>This digital garden</h2>
  
  <p>Unlike a traditional blog, this site is structured as a <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history" target="_blank">digital garden</a> ‚Äî a collection of ideas, essays, and notes that grow and evolve over time. Some notes are polished, others are works in progress. The focus is on creating connections between ideas rather than presenting a chronological feed.</p>
  
  <p>Feel free to explore using the topic tags, browsing the writing section, or following the links between notes. The site works best when you follow your curiosity rather than trying to read it from start to finish.</p>
