        <div class="content prose prose-lg max-w-none"><p>Back in 2017, AI was still quite a niche area. It was more focused on deep learning, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). If you are part of that cohort, you&rsquo;ll fondly remember OpenAI&rsquo;s website having all of these agents chasing each other in mazes playing various games as they explored reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>At the time I was running miDrive, a startup that I had raised ~$10m for, focused on the EdTech sector - bringing learning to drive into the digital age (and all of the transactions that go along with it: first car, insurance, etc.). After much reflection, I had grown the company to a stage that I could feel proud about, and completed much of the innovative product work. And I couldn&rsquo;t help but keep being drawn to artificial intelligence at the weekend.</p>
<p>Always being a founder, and thinking a few horizons out - I knew that AI would be the transformational technology of my lifetime. And I wanted to be living and breathing it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I made a calculated bet to go to a large corporate (with deep pockets) and no external pressures other than focusing on learning and building my expertise amongst some of the world&rsquo;s leading scientists. I joined a large asset manager as global head of AI products, and was tasked with infusing AI, ML, and NLP throughout the portfolio management.</p>
<p>Armed with deep technical knowledge and battle-tested experience deploying AI at scale, I was ready to return to my founder roots. The years as a senior executive at a large publicly traded company at the forefront of AI adoption had given me something invaluable: credibility that would matter when fundraising, coupled with insights into the real challenges enterprises face when implementing AI systems.</p>
<p>That journey led to <strong><a href="https://entourage.tech/">entourage</a></strong>. I&rsquo;ve always admired systems that get smarter through collaboration. Think of open-source projects where one coder&rsquo;s fix helps thousands. Now apply that to AI agents. Most agents today work in silos. They tackle problems, but their lessons vanish after the task.</p>
<p>We started entourage to fix that. Our core idea is a shared memory protocol for AI agents. Agents capture experiences during tasks—successes, failures, patterns—and assimilate them into reusable knowledge. This isn&rsquo;t offline training; it&rsquo;s real-time learning embedded in the work. Retrieve what&rsquo;s needed based on context, and the whole network improves.</p>
