Feeling pretty exhausted

**stumbled upon this thread on r/AI_agents:**

Altera.ai ran an experiment where 1,000 autonomous agents were placed into a Minecraft world. Left to act on their own, they started forming alliances, created a currency using gems, traded resources, and even engaged in corruption.

Itâ€™s called Project Sid, and it explores how AI agents behave in complex environments.

Interesting look at what happens when you give AI free rein in a sandbox world.
