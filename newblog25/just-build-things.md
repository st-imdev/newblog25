There was a meme going around X over the past few days highlighting that if you want to change something, make something, or usher something into existence that 'you can just build'.

And it has never been more true.

2025 is going to be the year of builders who just jump in with both feet, hack around, inject some creativity, build in public and listen to the feedback loop.

I truly think the non-tech / product manager route has come to an end. And that's speaking as someone who has been 'product' for over a decade. The pivotal fork in the road is for those who ended up becoming more technical (I'd count myself in here) and those who didn't.

So go play around with all the AI tooling out there, start to learn tech stacks, dream something up and just build it. I can promise you won't regret it.
