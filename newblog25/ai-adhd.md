If you're anything like me and always have ideas for products, the advent of the AI coding assistant has made it much easier (and quicker) to prove out a hypothesis - alone.

Trouble is, my mind never switches off! I now have a long list of trials that I want to experiment with, leading to slight burnout as my brain goes into overdrive.

Want to invent an LLM protocol similar to sitemaps? No problem, just fire up Cursor. Want to build a health tracking app? No problem, just fire up Cursor.

I've finally started to be a bit more rigorous about what I allow to take up the couple of spare hours I have per day, rather than nursing an ever expanding portfolio of apps & ideas.

I canâ€™t be the only one that feels slight overwhelm at this new found superpower.
