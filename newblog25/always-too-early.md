I've always been drawn to emerging technologies long before they become mainstream—from launching startups in my teens to exploring AI a decade before its current renaissance. This early-adopter mindset has given me unique insights and perspectives, allowing me to see possibilities others might miss. But there's an interesting tension in being wired this way: just as one technology begins to mature and show its full potential, my curiosity inevitably pulls me toward the next frontier.

This isn't about missed opportunities so much as it is about the natural evolution of interests. While there's clear value in staying the course with certain technologies—as my long-term commitment to AI has shown—there's also something special about being among the first to explore new technological territories. The challenge lies not in changing this aspect of myself, but in finding the right balance between persistent dedication and the excitement of new discoveries.

I'm curious: do you experience this same pull toward the new and unexplored? How do you balance the depth that comes from staying committed to one path with the breadth that comes from exploring new frontiers? I'd love to hear how others navigate this tension between persistence and curiosity.
