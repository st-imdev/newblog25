And that&rsquo;s speaking as someone who has been &lsquo;product&rsquo; for over a decade. The pivotal fork in the road is for those who ended up becoming more technical (I&rsquo;d count myself in here) and those who didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>So go play around with all the AI tooling out there, start to learn tech stacks, dream something up and just build it. I can promise you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p></div></article></section></main><footer class="container small muted"><p>© 2025 Scott Taylor.</p><style>footer.container{border-top:1px solid hsl(var(--border));padding:2rem 3rem;margin-top:4rem}</style></footer></body></html>
