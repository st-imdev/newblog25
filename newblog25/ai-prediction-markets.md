For the best part of a decade I've worked on building advanced AI trading systems; first, at one of the world's largest asset managers, and then my own proprietary trading systems for the past couple of years.

Lately something that's been fascinating to me are prediction markets - like Polymarket.

There are obviously a lot of parallels, in terms of the heavy lifting, that AI can do between equity markets and prediction markets. And as with any nascent market there is a lot of opportunity for early adopters and those with the technological advantage.

I've been spending some time experimenting with simple strategies and rudimentary approaches to these prediction markets, with encouraging early results.
