Every so often, I catch myself forgetting just how extraordinary our era is. Technology has accelerated at an incredible pace throughout my lifetime. When I was about ten, I remember using dial-up Internet and waiting ages for pages to load. Now, at a moment's notice, I can access the world's knowledge and communicate with pretty much anyone in the world.

Tonight, I was lying in bed and glanced out of the skylight at a plane overhead. I wondered where it was going, opened FlightRadar, and discovered it was heading to Icelandâ€”just like that. It's a simple reminder of how remarkable our technology has become.

These everyday moments are a powerful nudge: we live in an astonishing age, and it's worth taking a moment to appreciate all the wonders we have at our fingertips.
