January started with a bang—and then a sniffle.

We're only a few days into the new year, and of course I got hit by the flu. Well, I say flu, the last time I felt like this was when I had COVID... I've got some tests arriving today to know for sure that it wasn't.

It would've been easy to throw in the towel on my goals and put them on pause until I felt better. After all, being sick gives you the perfect excuse, right?

But instead of giving up, I just took it slow.

I didn't need to conquer mountains while bedridden; I just needed to keep nibbling away bit by bit. Small steps—reading a page, jotting down a quick thought, or taking 10 minutes to reflect—kept me moving forward. Progress wasn't flashy, but it was still progress.

And now, on the other side of it, I'm glad I didn't let a rough start derail the rest of the month.

It's a reminder that life will throw spanners in the works. The key is not stopping altogether, even when you feel like you're running on fumes. Small efforts add up over time. So, if you're having a rough patch, take a breather—but don't stop.
