07:18 - Testing out the addition of time

07:27 - Testing out a second thought with some time added.

08:11 - Finally fixed the styling, I think.

08:14 - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur placerat congue elit, et ornare risus convallis ut. Integer egestas magna vel elit ornare, eget gravida est fermentum. Fusce sagittis arcu mauris, a varius magna eleifend et. Maecenas gravida nibh ac iaculis feugiat. Nam dignissim eget sapien ac varius. Duis sagittis lacus ac eros lacinia, in tincidunt risus ornare.

09:56 - Getting back into gym sessions after holiday is always difficult. Just had my first little run â€” maybe get some weights in this evening, if I find the time. Also got my Whoop 5.0 device, great to see all of the new features (e.g. healthspan). Will have fun playing about with it. From first glance, I'm not getting anywhere near enough sleep. Largest detractor from my healthspan, I believe.
