This morning, my Sage coffee machine decided to go on strike. Instead of its usual burr-grinding hum, it made a strange clicking sound and refused to do anything useful with the beans I'd just poured in. My immediate thought was: "Great. How much is this going to cost to fix? Or is it even worth fixing?"

Normally, I'd be halfway to the manufacturer's website, looking up warranty details or trying to remember where I'd filed the receipt. But before giving up completely, I typed the issue into YouTube. Sure enough, someone had posted a six-minute video showing exactly how to fix a jammed grinder on my model.

I propped my phone up next to the machine and started following along. Step one: unplug everything. Next: take off the hopper, then unscrew the top burr, and so on. Soon enough, I found a clump of ground coffee packed in where it shouldn't be. A toothbrush and a bit of careful poking sorted that out. I put everything back together, feeling, to be honest, a little nervous—like I was defusing a bomb rather than fixing a coffee maker.

When I plugged it back in and tried again, the grinder spun up normally. I got coffee. It wasn't a huge deal, but I was more pleased with myself than I expected. The whole thing took about twenty minutes, but afterward, I started thinking about how much we rely on other people—or just give up—instead of trying to repair things ourselves. My grandfather wouldn't have thought twice about opening something up and having a go. For his generation, it was just normal. These days, it almost feels rebellious to even try.

This all reminded me a bit of *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*. I remember reading it and thinking the philosophy was a bit abstract, but now I get it a bit more. There's something rewarding in paying attention to how things work, being present, and fixing even small problems with your own hands and a bit of patience. Following along with a stranger on YouTube and rooting around in a coffee grinder isn't the same as tuning up a motorcycle on the side of the road, but it's the same mindset. My coffee tasted better that morning, or at least I thought it did.

Next time something stops working, I hope I remember to try a toothbrush and a YouTube video before reaching for the warranty details.
